 Background of the Project 
  
With the depletion of non-renewable energy sources, it has become 
essential to explore alternative methods of energy production. The 
"Advanced Foot Step Power Generator" aims to convert mechanical 
pressure exerted by human footsteps into usable electrical energy. It is 
an innovative and sustainable approach towards green energy. 

 Problem Statement 
   Day by day, the population of the country increases and the 
requirement of the power is  increases. At the same time, the wastage 
of energy also 6 increases in many   ways. so reforming this energy 
back to usable form is a major concern. As technology is developed 
and the use of gadgets, electronic devices also increased. Power 
generation using conservative methods becoming deficient. There is a 
need arises for a different power generation method. At the same time, 
the energy is wasted due to human locomotion. 


Objectives 
To overcome this problem, the energy wastage is converted to usable 
form using the piezoelectric sensor. This sensor converts the pressure 
on it to a voltage. By using this energy saving method, foot step power 
generation system we are generating power. A piezoelectric sensor is a 
device that uses the piezoelectric effect, to measure changes in 
pressure, acceleration, temperature, strain, or force by converting them 
to an electrical charge. 
  
 
 
Scope of the Project 
1- In gymnasiums where people can exercise and create some power.  
2- In dancing clubs where people can dance an 
generate power. 
3-  In train stations because there’s usually high density of people so it 
can be effective. 
4- To develop a compact, efficient, and cost-effective footstep power 
generator.  
5-  To explore various mechanisms for optimizing energy conversion 
(mechanical springs, rack-pinion systems, piezoelectric materials, 
etc.).   
6- To implement energy storage systems for effective utilization. 
7-   To demonstrate the application of the generated power for real
time usage such as lighting or mobile charging. 
 
By utilizing the simple act of walking, the footstep power generation system 
provides an innovative solution to contribute to clean energy generation, 
making it a step towards a greener and more sustainable future.
