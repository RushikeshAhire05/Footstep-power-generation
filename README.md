# Footstep-power-generation
The "Advanced Foot Step Power Generator" project is designed to harness  mechanical energy produced by foot traffic and convert it into electrical  energy.   This system utilizes piezoelectric sensors and mechanical assemblies to  capture energy from footsteps, which is then stored in rechargeable batteries.
